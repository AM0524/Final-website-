Our client, Tim Regalado, requested to have his webpage themed around travel. Tim’s trip to Europe during college changed his life and opened his eyes to many different cultures and locations and found himself falling in love with traveling. Our group’s and Tim's vision combined into one to make a website inspired by his travels.
